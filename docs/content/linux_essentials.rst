Linux Essentials
================

After working through tis material, attendees should be able to:

* Describe basic functions of essential Linux commands
* Use Linux commands to navigate a file system and manipulate files
* Transfer data to / from a remote Linux file system
* Edit files directly on a Linux system using a command line utility (e.g. vim,
  nano, emacs)

Topics covered in this module include:

* Creating and navigating folders (``pwd``, ``ls``, ``mkdir``, ``cd``, ``rmdir``)
* Creating and manipulating files (``touch``, ``rm``, ``mv``, ``cp``)
* Looking at the contents of files (``cat``, ``more``, ``less``, ``head``, ``tail``, ``grep``)
* Network and file transfers (``hostname``, ``whoami``, ``logout``, ``ssh``, ``scp``, ``rsync``)
* Text editing with vim (insert mode, normal mode, navigating, saving, quitting)


Log in to Longhorn
------------------

To log in to the `Longhorn cluster <https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/longhorn>`_,
follow the instructions for your operating system or ssh client below.

**Mac / Linux**

.. code-block:: bash

   Open the application 'Terminal'
   ssh username@longhorn.tacc.utexas.edu
   (enter password)
   (enter 6-digit token)


**Windows**

.. code-block:: bash

   Open the application 'PuTTY'
   enter Host Name: longhorn.tacc.utexas.edu
   (click 'Open')
   (enter username)
   (enter password)
   (enter 6-digit token)



If you can't access Longhorn yet, a local or web-based Linux environment
will work for this guide. However, you will need to access Longhorn for
future materials.

Try this `Linux environment in a browser <https://bellard.org/jslinux/vm.html?url=alpine-x86.cfg&mem=192>`_.



Creating and Navigating Folders
-------------------------------

On a Windows or Mac desktop, our present location determines what files and
folders we can access. I can "see" my present location visually with the help of
the graphic interface - I could be looking at my Desktop, or the contents of a
folder, for example. In a Linux command-line interface, we lack the same visual
queues to tell us what our location is. Instead, we use a command - ``pwd``
(print working directory) - to tell us our present location. Try executing this
command in the terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pwd
   /home/03439/wallen

This home location on the Linux filesystem is unique for each user, and it is
roughly analogous to C:\\Users\\username on Windows, or /Users/username on Mac.

To see what files and folders are available at this location, use the ``ls``
(list) command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ls

I have no files or folders in my home directory yet, so I do not get a response.
We can create some folders using the ``mkdir`` (make directory) command. The
words 'folder' and 'directory' are interchangeable:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ mkdir folder1
   $ mkdir folder2
   $ mkdir folder3

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ls
   folder1 folder2 folder3

Now we have some folders to work with. To "open" a folder, navigate into that
folder using the ``cd`` (change directory) command. This process is analogous to
double-clicking a folder on Windows or Mac:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pwd
   /home/03439/wallen/
   $ cd folder1
   $ pwd
   /home/03439/wallen/folder1

Now that we are inside ``folder1``, make a few sub-folders:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ mkdir subfolderA
   $ mkdir subfolderB
   $ mkdir subfolderC
   $ ls
   subfolderA subfolderB subfolderC

Use ``cd`` to Navigate into ``subfolderA``, then use ``ls`` to list the
contents. What do you expect to see?

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd subfolderA
   $ pwd
   /home/03439/wallen/folder1/subfolderA
   $ ls

There is nothing there because we have not made anything yet. Next, we will
navigate back to the home directory. So far we have seen how to navigate "down"
into folders, but how do we navigate back "up" to the parent folder? There are
different ways to do it. For example, we could specify the complete path of
where we want to go:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pwd
   /home/03439/wallen/folder1/subfolderA
   $ cd /home/03439/wallen/folder1
   $ pwd
   /home/03439/wallen/folder1/

Or, we could use a shortcut, ``..``, which refers to the **parent folder** - one
level higher than the present location:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pwd
   /home/03439/wallen/folder1
   $ cd ..
   $ pwd
   /home/03439/wallen

We are back in our home directory. Finally, use the  ``rmdir`` (remove
directory) command to remove folders. This will not work on folders that have
any contents (more on this later):

.. code-block:: bash

   $ mkdir junkfolder
   $ ls
   folder1 folder2 folder3 junkfolder
   $ rmdir junkfolder
   $ ls
   folder1 folder2 folder3


Before we move on, let's remove the directories we have made, using ``rm -r`` to
remove our parent folder ``folder1`` and its subfolders. The ``-r`` command line
option recursively removes subfolders and files located "down" the parent
directory. ``-r`` is required for non-empty folders.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ rm -r folder1
   $ ls
   folder2 folder3

Which command should we use to remove ``folder2`` and ``folder3``?

.. code-block:: bash

   $ rmdir folder2
   $ rmdir folder3
   $ ls


Creating and Manipulating Files
-------------------------------

We have seen how to navigate around the filesystem and perform operations with
folders. But, what about files? Just like on Windows or Mac, we can easily
create new files, copy files, rename files, and move files to different
locations. First, we will navigate to the home directory and create a few new
folders and files with the ``mkdir`` and ``touch`` commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd     # cd on an empty line will automatically take you back to the home directory
   $ pwd
   /home/03439/wallen
   $ mkdir folder1
   $ mkdir folder2
   $ mkdir folder3
   $ touch file_a
   $ touch file_b
   $ touch file_c
   $ ls
   file_a  file_b  file_c  folder1  folder2  folder3

These files we have created are all empty. Removing a file is done with the
``rm`` (remove) command. Please note that on Linux file systems, there is no
"Recycle Bin". Any file or folder removed is gone forever and often
un-recoverable:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ touch junkfile
   $ rm junkfile

Moving files with the ``mv`` command and copying files with the ``cp`` command
works similarly to how you would expect on a Windows or Mac machine. The context
around the move or copy operation determines what the result will be. For
example, we could move and/or copy files into folders:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ mv file_a folder1/
   $ mv file_b folder2/
   $ cp file_c folder3/

Before listing the results with ``ls``, try to guess what the result will be.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ls
   file_c folder1  folder2  folder3
   $ ls folder1
   file_a
   $ ls folder2
   file_b
   $ ls folder3
   file_c

Two files have been moved into folders, and ``file_c`` has been copied - so
there is still a copy of ``file_c`` in the home directory. Move and copy
commands can also be used to change the name of a file:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cp file_c file_c_copy
   $ mv file_c file_c_new_name

By now, you may have found that Linux is very unforgiving with typos. Generous
use of the ``<Tab>`` key to auto-complete file and folder names, as well as the
``<UpArrow>`` to cycle back through command history, will greatly improve the
experience. As a general rule, try not to use spaces or strange characters in
files or folder names. Stick to:

.. code-block:: bash

   A-Z     # capital letters
   a-z     # lowercase letters
   0-9     # digits
   -       # hyphen
   _       # underscore
   .       # period

Before we move on, let's clean up once again by removing the files and folders
we have created. Do you remember the command for removing non-empty folders?

.. code-block:: bash

   $ rm -r folder1
   $ rm -r folder2
   $ rm -r folder3

How do we remove ``file_c_copy`` and ``file_c_new_name``?

.. code-block:: bash

   $ rm file_c_copy
   $ rm file_c_new_name





Looking at the Contents of Files
--------------------------------

Everything we have seen so far has been with empty files and folders. We will
now start looking at some real data. Navigate to your home directory, then issue
the following ``cp`` command to copy a public file on the server to your local
space:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd ~    # the tilde ~ is also a shortcut referring to your home directory
   $ pwd
   /home/03439/wallen
   $ cp /usr/share/dict/linux.words .
   $ ls
   words

Try to use ``<Tab>`` to autocomplete the name of the file. Also, please notice
the single dot ``.`` at the end of the copy command, which indicates that you
want to cp the file to ``.``, this present location (your home directory).

This ``linux.words`` file is a standard file that can be found on most Linux operating
systems. It contains 479,828 words, each word on its own line. To see the
contents of a file, use the ``cat`` command to print it to screen:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cat linux.words
   1080
   10-point
   10th
   11-point
   12-point
   16-point
   18-point
   1st
   2
   20-point


This is a long file! Printing everything to screen is much too fast and not very
useful. We can use a few other commands to look at the contents of the file with
``more`` control:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ more linux.words

Press the ``<Enter>`` key to scroll through line-by-line, or the ``<Space>`` key
to scroll through page-by-page. Press ``q`` to quit the view, or ``<Ctrl+c>`` to
force a quit if things freeze up. A ``%`` indicator at the bottom of the screen
shows your progress through the file. This is still a little bit messy and fills
up the screen. The ``less`` command has the same effect, but is a little bit
cleaner:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ less linux.words

Scrolling through the data is the same, but now we can also search the data.
Press the ``/`` forward slash key, and type a word that you would like to search
for. The screen will jump down to the first match of that word. The ``n`` key
will cycle through other matches, if they exist.

Finally, you can view just the beginning or the end of a file with the ``head``
and ``tail`` commands. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ head linux.words
   $ tail linux.words

The ``>`` and ``>>`` shortcuts in Linux indicate that you would like to redirect
the output of one of the commands above. Instead of printing to screen, the
output can be redirected into a file:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cat linux.words > words_new.txt
   $ head linux.words > first_10_lines.txt

A single greater than sign ``>`` will redirect and **overwrite** any contents in
the target file. A double greater than sign ``>>`` will redirect and **append**
any output to the end of the target file.

One final useful way to look at the contents of files is with the ``grep``
command. ``grep`` searches a file for a specific pattern, and returns all lines
that match the pattern. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ grep "banana" linux.words
   banana
   bananaquit
   bananas
   cassabanana

Although it is not always necessary, it is safe to put the search term in
quotes.




Network and File Transfers
--------------------------

In order to login or transfer files to a remote Linux file system, you must know
the hostname (unique network identifier) and the username. If you are already on
a Linux file system, those are easy to determine using the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ whoami
   wallen
   $ hostname -f
   login1.longhorn.tacc.utexas.edu

Given that information, a user would remotely login to this Linux machine using
ssh in a Terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   [local]$ ssh wallen@longhorn.tacc.utexas.edu
   (enter password)
   (enter 6-digit token)
   [longhorn]$

Windows users would typically use the program **PuTTY** (or another SSH client)
to perform this operation. Logging out of a remote system is done using the
``logout`` command, or the shortcut ``<Ctrl+d>``:

.. code-block:: bash

  [longhorn]$ logout
  [local]$


Copying files from your local computer to your home folder on Longhorn would require
the ``scp`` command (Windows users use a client "WinSCP"):

.. code-block:: bash

   [local]$ scp my_file wallen@longhorn.tacc.utexas.edu:/home/03439/wallen/
   (enter password)
   (enter 6-digit token)


In this command, you specify the name of the file you want to transfer
(``my_file``), the username (``wallen``), the hostname
(``longhorn.tacc.utexas.edu``), and the path you want to put the file
(``/home/03439/wallen/``). Take careful notice of the separators including spaces,
the ``@`` symbol, and the ``:``.

Copy files from Longhorn to your local computer using the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   [local]$ scp wallen@longhorn.tacc.utexas.edu:/home/03439/wallen/my_file ./
   (enter password)
   (enter 6-digit token)


Instead of files, full directories can be copied using the "recursive" flag
(``scp -r ...``). The ``rsync`` tool is an advanced copy tool that is useful for
synching data between two sites. Although we will not go into depth here,
example ``rsync`` usage is as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ rsync -azv local remote
   $ rsync -azv remote local

This is just the basics of copying files. See example
`scp usage <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_copy>`_ and example
`rsync usage <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync>`_ for more info.




Text Editing with VIM
---------------------

VIM is a text editor used on Linux file systems.

Open a file (or create a new file if it does not exist):

.. code-block:: bash

   $ vim file_name

There are two "modes" in VIM that we will talk about today. They are called
"insert mode" and "normal mode". In insert mode, the user is typing text into a
file as seen through the terminal (think about typing text into TextEdit or
Notepad). In normal mode, the user can perform other functions like save, quit,
cut and paste, find and replace, etc. (think about clicking the menu options in
TextEdit or Notepad). The two main keys to remember to toggle between the modes
are ``i`` and ``Esc``.

Entering VIM insert mode:

.. code-block:: bash

   > i

Entering VIM normal mode:

.. code-block:: bash

   > Esc

A summary of the most important keys to know for normal mode are:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Navigating the file:

   arrow keys        move up, down, left, right
       Ctrl+u        page up
       Ctrl+d        page down

            0        move to beginning of line
            $        move to end of line

           gg        move to beginning of file
            G        move to end of file
           :N        move to line N

   # Saving and quitting:

           :q        quit editing the file
           :q!       quit editing the file without saving

           :w        save the file, continue editing
           :wq       save and quit
